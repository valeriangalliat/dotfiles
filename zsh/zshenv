# When starting X through a TTY, the environment will be loaded once already,
# so when we open a new terminal, this file is sourced again and we'll
# duplicate everything.
#
# Or even when using a login manager, I like those paths to be available to
# programs in the graphical session so I also source this file in
# `~/.xprofile` and we end up with the the same duplication in terminals.
